## Sobre o projeto

This project consists of an **API** developed in **.NET** for starting a new project. The **API** allows users to register by providing their name, email address, and password. 

The **API** supports **MySQL** and **SQLServer** as database options, providing flexibility in choosing the data storage environment. The configuration of **CI/CD** pipelines and integration with **Sonarcloud** ensure continuous code analysis, promoting more robust and secure development.

Following the principles of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **SOLID**, the project architecture seeks to maintain a modular and sustainable design. Data validation is performed using **FluentValidation**, ensuring that all data entries meet the established criteria.

To ensure code quality, **unit and integration tests** are implemented. The use of **dependency injection** promotes better code modularity and testability, facilitating project maintenance and evolution.

Other technologies and practices adopted include **Entity Framework** for object-relational mapping, the agile **SCRUM** methodology for project management, and the implementation of **JWT & Refresh Tokens** for secure authentication. Database migrations are managed to ensure controlled evolution of the data schema. In addition, the use of **Git** and the **GitFlow** branching strategy assist in the organization and control of code versions.
